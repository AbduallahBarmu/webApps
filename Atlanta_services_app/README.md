Front-end web development, also we can call it “client-side development” the internship was practice on these technology HTML5, CSS3, bootstrap and JavaScript. The goal from this training is to learn how to design website interfaces, by working an integrated project for general services website with this name (Atlanta service)
The site provides a general service for users starting from the sign in / up pages for the normal user and service provider moving to Main Page Which contain the services that we will provides in this website (Medical clinics, Real estate offices, Restaurants, legal offices , Tourism offices )

The project was associated with another student working on a back-end side and this is based on association in the work between me and him, in order to design an integrated website
The methodology that is worked on to manage the project is Agile as well as the all my work on this project by using HTMl5 and CSS3, bootstrap libraries, JS
The reason for using these technologies is that we need to build the structure of website content mean here the HTML and to create a layout and design or make a simple animation for the html elements that we need to use CSS. And to make our works easier and more active we need to use a library so that I used bootstrap. 
Finally, the most important part JavaScript it becomes a very important programming language that is used in web design to apply changes in the html or apply some logic to web page by processing data.  Also, it is used to receiving or submitting data from the browser from/to a server 

In general I start with analyzing the project and working on manually designing the pages on papers then getting start using the previous technologies and get start coding by designing the main interfaces of the site, then the main and subsidiary pages , services pages , profiles pages and bookings pages  

In this internship I have accomplished everything mentioned in the project details and all the tasks are mentioned in the table in the third section. Through this training I gained experience in how to work as a web designer, how to work together with other people on the same project in a real work environment and how is the process of linking between Back-End and Front-End side
I also learned how executing tasks on time, and if we faced a problem how would we solve it together to can continue in work

My work based on the skills that I learned in some of courses in web development track the first one include:  HTML5, CSS3 , Bootstrab4 , JS , Dom Manipulation

I was looking forward to working on “jQuery “by using java script and React framework in order to design more professional website, this will be one of my future plans to develop my skills in this field
The source of my work on this internship was based on this book and bootstrap library:
